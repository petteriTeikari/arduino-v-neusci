# arduino-v-neusci

Project documentation of how to use Arduino-based microcontroller platforms in neuroscience research when a LED control is needed.

The scientific publication for the program code is the following: 

Teikari, Petteri, Raymond P. Najjar, Hemi A.I. Malkki, Kenneth Knoblauch, Dominique Dumortier, Claude Gronfier, and Howard M. Cooper. <b>“An Inexpensive Arduino-based LED Stimulator System for Vision Research.”</b> Journal of Neuroscience Methods, Volume 211, Issue 2, 15 November 2012, Pages 227–236. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2012.09.012

This used to be in https://code.google.com/p/arduino-v-neusci/, but as code.google is closing down, it got exported here.
